=> Task : Initial setup and hello glass screen

- Make sure Glass Preview SDK (API level 19) is downloaded
- Create blank project (without any activity)
- How to start application : Set up voice trigger
	- create a string in strings.xml
	- create res/xml directory
	- create voice_trigger_start.xml
	- for a custom command add permission in manifest
- Talk about components : Activity, Service, Receivers, Providers

// Pattern : Immersion
- Create a blank activity, layout, configure all
- In manifest, add activity, **add activity icon** NOTE: Asset guidelines for icons
- Add the VOICE_TRIGGER filter
- Run and Observe:
   - App is invoked using voice command
   - App is listed with icon
   - check theme is messed up

** Code : Check point 1 **

- Remove theme from manifest and try again

- This is Immersion : tradition android way
Your application takes over the screen, but after time out its gone again. Not really immersive!
Design decision

NOTE : update build.gradle to point to Sneak peak version

compileSdkVersion "Google Inc.:Glass Development Kit Preview:19"
